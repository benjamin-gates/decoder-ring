# Project - Decoder Ring
This application gives three different coding/decoding tools for the user create, then solve.

## Context for Project
The purpose of this project was to test my ability to use conditional statements and work with strings and arrays in JavaScript. I only wrote the JavaScript files in src for this project.

## Technologies
- JavaScript

## Features
This webpage gives the user to create and decode:
1. Caesar Shift
1. Polybius Square
1. Substitution Cipher
puzzles.

### Caesar Shift

In Caesar Shift, the user is given a random string of numbers, which they need to figure out how far the alphabet "shifted" in order to decode the message.

### Polybius Square

In Polybius Square, the user is given a list of numbers, where each pair of numbers represents the row and column of a letter in an array.

### Substitution Cipher

In Substitution Cipher, the user is given a substitution alphabet that they need to use in order to decode the message.

## Learnings from the Project
I learned how to access specific characters and substrings in a string to create new strings. I also experienced taking arrays to strings and vice versa in order to more easily create a desired result (working with arrays was easier in some cases).

## Future Plans for this Project
I have no future plans for this project. This was one of my first projects in the Thinkful program.
